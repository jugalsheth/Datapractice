# Stocks-with-Pandaspy
My main purpose was to use the pandaspy library, in my #66daysofdata, i came across this library which proves to be atleast a 100 times faster than pandas in processing and works best for small datasets

# Process
Used pandaspy as pp
- Read data as an array
- Performed pivot and wrangling on array to get the closing of stocks
- Matplotlib to plot a time series sequence of stocks
